    - question: "What is Cloud Native?"
      answer: "Cloud Native is an approach to building and running applications that fully leverages the advantages of the cloud. Cloud Native applications are modular, scalable, and highly available. They are run in containers and dynamically orchestrated. Cloud Native technologies are open source and supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)."

    - question: "What are the benefits of Cloud Native?"
      answer: "Cloud Native applications are modular, scalable, and highly available. They can be developed and deployed faster. By automating processes, operational stability is increased. Furthermore, Cloud Native applications are cost-efficient and can be operated flexibly."

    - question: "What is Kubernetes?"
      answer: "Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes is the leading platform for container orchestration and is used by many companies worldwide."

    - question: "What is OpenShift?"
      answer: "OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution developed by Red Hat. It is based on Kubernetes and offers additional features for developing, operating, and scaling Cloud Native applications. OpenShift is a container platform built on top of Kubernetes and supported by Red Hat."

    - question: "What is a container?"
      answer: "A container is a standardized unit of software that contains all the necessary dependencies to run an application. Containers are isolated and run on a shared operating system. They are lightweight and can be started and stopped quickly. Containers are the foundation for Cloud Native applications."

    - question: "What is a microservice?"
      answer: "A microservice is a small, independent service that performs a specific function."
