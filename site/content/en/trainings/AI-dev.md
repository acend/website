main_text: "Artificial Intelligence has arrived in software development – but a gap often remains between marketing promises and productive team use. Many tools promise increased productivity, but daily operations lack clear rules, suitable use cases, and a shared roadmap.\n\n
In this two-day training, software teams learn how to integrate AI into their existing development process in a practical and secure way – from requirements and implementation to testing, documentation, and operations.\n\n
By the end, participants will have practiced use cases, clear guardrails for data protection and security, and a prioritized roadmap for establishing AI responsibly within their team.\n\n
Examples and exercises are demonstrated using the Atlassian tool stack (Jira, Confluence), GitHub Copilot, Playwright, and Azure, but can easily be applied to other tools and providers."
