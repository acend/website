lead: "acend trainer Gabriel Graf trained the team at PostFinance AG during the introduction of Kubernetes technology. He knows the paradigm shift that comes with it all too well from his own practical experience. In his main job, Gabriel is a Cloud Engineer at Swiss Mobiliar. The fact that he knows both sides as a trainer was particularly well-received during the IT training sessions at PostFinance."

### What was the reason for the training?

PostFinance introduced containers and Kubernetes across the board. This is a new way of operating and deploying software. The transition requires new ways of thinking and brings its own language. I have gone through such transitions myself and, as a trainer, I enable others to grasp this technology quickly and use it effectively.

### Who participated in the training?

The participants came from the fields of management, software engineering, data science, business analysis, and software testing. The spectrum ranged from beginners who had never worked with Kubernetes to a few experts. The great thing was that the participants collaborated across different teams.

### How are the training sessions structured?

The training is a varied mix of theoretical foundations and labs. We directly reference the company's IT infrastructure. In the case of PostFinance, an internal specialist was present to represent the "company DNA." This allowed us to address the specific starting situation of PostFinance, and the tools could be tested one-to-one in the participants' own environment and put directly into practice.

### What is your conclusion regarding the IT training?

acend helped us anchor Cloud Native technologies like Kubernetes across our entire IT department. Building up the know-how of all stakeholders is incredibly important during the transformation to a new Cloud Native infrastructure.

### What did you particularly appreciate about the training?

What we especially value about acend is the practical orientation of the trainers. They teach technologies and architectural concepts that they use operationally in practice, which creates a dialogue at eye level. People enjoyed the training and were noticeably motivated to apply what they had learned.

### What importance do you attach to IT further education?

An important solution in the fight against the shortage of skilled workers in the IT industry is the training and strengthening of existing teams. Here, acend's training is very valuable.
