At Baloise Park in Basel, the headquarters of the financial services provider with 8,000 employees across Europe, a strong wind blows around the three architecturally striking buildings this afternoon. Inside, Product Owner Nikolas Philips and Head of Engineering Joachim Prinzbach from Baloise’s IT department welcome us for a relaxed interview. They have just completed two extensive training periods with acend and are happy to take a moment to look back and share their experiences.

### What was the trigger for the training?

Nikolas: We underwent a partial modernization of Baloise’s application infrastructure. IT generally never stands still. With every technological development, employee further education is central.
Joachim: Another goal was the independence of the application teams, to be as independent as possible from external factors and to increase efficiency thanks to shorter communication paths. To achieve this, the teams needed the right tools.

### How did you come across acend?

Nikolas: A few years ago, we initially wanted to train the employees ourselves, but there simply wasn't enough time – and the necessary pedagogical know-how was missing. We already knew some of the trainers and thought it was cool when acend launched their training offer shortly after. Right from the first introductory meeting, we knew it was a great fit, both professionally and personally.

### What convinced you?

Nikolas: The flexibility. Acend adapted the training specifically to our environment and, in particular, to our infrastructure. Their offer was tailored exactly to us. Meaning, we could cut out irrelevant topics and add more important ones instead. Additionally, we were able to benefit from their wealth of experience. The trainers knew exactly how to handle the different knowledge levels of the participants. Advanced users were specifically challenged, and less experienced ones were ideally supported.

### How did the training sessions go?

Joachim: We had two broad training periods over a span of one and a half years. A total of 200 developers and system engineers were trained in OpenShift and Prometheus/Grafana. The training sessions took place on-site – in Basel, Germany, and Serbia. Between 12 and 16 employees participated per training unit, supported by two trainers – a very comfortable setting for a training course.

### What did the participants particularly appreciate about the training?

Nikolas: The training consisted of theoretical blocks and labs to get straight into practice. Solving tasks is important because that’s when mistakes happen. And since the trainers are on-site, there's no long search for a solution. This eliminates a major time-killer. Developers usually find a solution – but the question is how quickly and cleanly. Our goal was for employees to be able to apply what they learned immediately after the training. The more time passes between training and application, the less sticks.

### What has changed as a result of the training?

Joachim: The know-how is more widely available. This is evident in the fact that hardly any questions regarding the trained topics are asked in the support channel anymore. Self-sufficiency has been strengthened.

### How do Baloise customers benefit from this?

Joachim: Simple and practical digital services are a societal need. Many people no longer want to have to call to report a claim. A few clicks are enough. By staying on the ball, we can offer ever-better digital services.

### Why would you recommend acend?

Nikolas: The trainers come from a practical background and are very familiar with our daily business – in my view, the biggest recommendation feature.
Joachim: Another huge plus is the flexibility. Acend adapts to the customer's environment. I like that they are based locally in Switzerland. This meant the training could take place in our corporate language – as well as the exchange during the relaxed drinks (Apéro) after the training sessions.
